# Test `aries`

In R, source `run-test.r` to run the tests.
The results of the test will be shown
the file `test.html` (and `test.md`).

```
source("run-test.r")
```

Expected outputs can be found in the folder `test-output`.

*The tests do load and make use of ALSPAC
data using the `alspac` R package.
Consequently, only direct ALSPAC users will be
able to run the tests.*
