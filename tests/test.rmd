# Test `aries`

```{r rmd-init, echo=FALSE, message=F}
library(knitr)
options(knitr.kable.NA= '')
library(Cairo)
library(ggplot2)
opts_chunk$set(warning=FALSE,
               message=FALSE,
               fig.width=6, fig.height=6, dev="CairoPNG",
               stop=TRUE)
read_chunk('test.r')
options(stringsAsFactors=F)
```

We start by loading the package
and saving the directory containing the ARIES data.
```{r aries-init}
```

We will load ALSPAC data later as part of the test. 
For this we will use the `alspac` R package.
```{r alspac-init}
```

## Test `aries.feature.sets()`

```{r check-aries.feature.sets}
```

## Test `aries.time.points()`

```{r check-aries.feature.sets}
```

## Test `aries.select()`

We test `aries.select()` verifying that manually merging
subsets of samples gives the same result and requesting
all samples at the same time.

Constuct datasets with all age 15-17 year-old profiles,
just Illumina 450k profiles,
and just Illumina EPIC profiles
using `aries.select()`.

```{r apply-aries.select}
```

From the 450k and EPIC-only datasets,
construct a combined dataset manually.
```{r combine-manually}
```

For the comparison, we will need a function to determine
if two matrices are identical apart from different
row orderings. 
```{r identical.rows}
```

Check `aries.select()$cell.counts`:
```{r check-aries.select-cell.counts}
```

Check `aries.select()$samples`:
```{r check-aries.select-samples}
```

Checking `aries.select()$control.matrix` is slightly more
complicated because the controls in the 450k and EPIC bead chips
are somewhat different. Instead of checking for a perfect match,
we verify that the control probe intensities are most correlated
for matching samples than for mismatching samples.
```{r check-aries.select-samples}
```

## Test `aries.methylation()`

We test `aries.methylation()` by testing associations of DNA methylation with:

- gestational age
- birthweight
- BMI
- alcohol intake
- smoking
- prenatal tobacco exposure
- age
- sex

### Preparing data for analyses

We load these exposure and phenotype variables from ALSPAC
as a data frame `alspac` ...
```{r load-alspac}
```

... EWAS summary statistics ...
```{r load-ewas}
```

... DNAm alcohol models ...
```{r load-alcohol-models}
```

... DNAm age models ...
```{r load-age-models}
```

... add DNAm models for prenatal tobacco exposure,
BMI, smoking, and sex ...
```{r add-models}
```

... collect CpG sites from EWAS summary statistics and DNAm models ...
```{r collect-cpg-sites}
```

... load ARIES DNAm profiles ...
```{r load-methylation}
```

```{r site-coverage,results="asis"}
``` 

... add ALSPAC exposure and phenotype variables to ARIES ...
```{r add-alspac-vars}
```

... and finally define functions for testing CpG site associations.
```{r test-assocs}
```

### Correlation with published EWAS effects

We fit models to test associations with DNAm
and calculate correlations between the effects we observe
here and effects reported in the literature.
```{r test-effect-correlations}
```

```{r,results="asis"}
kable(r.effects, digits=2)
```

As expected, correlation of:
- sex effects is nearly perfect.
- smoking effects roughly increases with time spent smoking to nearly perfect in middle age.
- prenatal smoking effects is high at birth and then decreases. Interestingly, the correlations settle around R=0.6 from age 3.5 (43 months) onward and is consistent with effects observed many years after birth (PMID29860346).
- birthweight is high at birth and then very inconsistent afterward (PMID25869828).  The >0.5 correlations at ages 7 and 9 appear to be real. The lack of correlation between birth and age 7 is likely due to extremely small sample sizes at those time points.
- gestational age is high at birth and then mostly disappears (PMID25869828).
- BMI is high in adults (it was derived in adults) and lower in children.

### Correlations with published DNAm models of continuous phenotypes/exposures

```{r test-model-correlations}
```

```{r,results="asis"}
kable(r.models, digits=2)
```

As expected, correlation of model scores with:
- age increases with age (models were developed in adults) and is highest where there is greatest age variation.
- BMI increases with age (models were developed in adults) with correlations similar to those published (PMID32228717).
- gestational age was high at expected levels at birth (PMID28932320) and then essentially null elsewhere.
- cotinine were quite high (R>0.45), however lower than published in another study (R=0.65, PMID24120260).
- alcohol were similar to those previously published (PMID31775873).
- audit score were similar to those previously published (PMID31775873).

### AUC for published DNAm models of binary exposures

```{r test-model-auc}
```

```{r,results="asis"}
kable(r.auc, digits=2)
```

As expected, AUC for DNAm models of:
- prenatal tobacco exposure was high (above 0.8) as published (PMID27323799).
- sex were nearly perfect.
- smoking was high for long-term smokers (above or near 0.9) and somewhat lower for newer smokers. 

### Evaluations of DNAm age acceleration (Hannum)

```{r calculate-dnam-age}
```

Correlation of DNAm age estimates is quite high as expected
across all of ARIES (R = `r with(aries$all$samples, cor(hannum, age, use="p"))`).

```{r,echo=F}
print(ggplot(aries$all$samples,
             aes(x=age,
                 y=hannum,
                 color=factor(time_point))) +
      geom_point())
```


Consistent with the literature (PMID27511193),
adult males tend to have higher age acceleration than females.

```{r dnam-aa-by-sex}
```

```{r,results="asis"}
kable(dnam.aa.by.sex,digits=2)
```
(The 'middle age' group combines ALSPAC mothers and fathers
at middle age, i.e. time points 'FOM' and 'FOF'). 

```{r,echo=F}
dat <- aries$all$samples
dat$group <- group
dat <- dat[!is.na(dat$group),]
print(ggplot(dat,
             aes(x=group,
                 y=age.accel,
                 fill=sex)) +
      geom_boxplot(position=position_dodge(1)))
```
